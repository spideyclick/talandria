# Shadow's Den

- [3] Assassins

## Loot

- Assassin's Blade: This magic dagger has a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls. On a hit, it deals an additional 1d6 poison damage. The blade is also coated in a special oil that allows it to deal an additional 2d6 damage to creatures with the undead or fiendish subtype.
- Ring of Shadows: This silver ring is set with a black onyx and allows the wearer to blend into shadows, gaining advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made in dim light or darkness. Additionally, once per day, the wearer can cast the invisibility spell on themselves.
- Shadow Cloak: This black cloak is made of a magical material that seems to absorb light. When worn, the wearer gains resistance to necrotic damage and can move through dim light or darkness as if it were difficult terrain.
- Assassin's Key: This key will immediately open the assassin's cache in the Shadow's Den:
  - Potion of Invisibility: This small vial contains a shimmering liquid that turns the drinker invisible for 1 hour.
  - Gold and Jewels: The assassins have a small stash of gold and valuable gems that they have accumulated from their various jobs. In total, the stash is worth 400 gold pieces.
  - Assassin's Journal: This leather-bound journal contains detailed notes on the assassins' various targets, including their strengths, weaknesses, and daily routines. The journal also contains a coded message that hints at a larger plot that the assassins are involved in.
  - Scroll of Darkness: This parchment scroll contains a single-use spell that creates a sphere of darkness, covering a 15-foot radius. The darkness lasts for 10 minutes, or until dispelled by a spell or magical effect. The scroll can be used by anyone who can cast 2nd-level spells.

***Assassinate.*** During its first turn, the assassin has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit the assassin scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.

***Evasion.*** If the assassin is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the assassin instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

***Sneak Attack (1/Turn).*** The assassin deals an extra 10 (3d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the assassin that isn't incapacitated and the assassin doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

***Multiattack.*** The assassin makes two melee attacks.

***Actions***
