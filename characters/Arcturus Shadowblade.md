*Formerly Arcturus Skyblade*

**Arcturus Shadowblade**, once a respected paladin with the name **SkyBlade**, fell from grace after witnessing a grave injustice that he felt he couldn't rectify through lawful means. Driven by anger and frustration, he turned to darker methods, using the free and unlimited powers given by **Graz'zt** to ruthlessly punish wrongdoers. Over time, his actions became increasingly extreme, and he now sees himself as a necessary force for order in a chaotic world. Arcturus is a feared and reviled figure, using his powers to further his own twisted agenda.
